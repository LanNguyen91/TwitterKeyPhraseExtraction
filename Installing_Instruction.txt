Requirement: Eclipse

Instruction:
1./ Clone the project from github
2./ Create a project from existing code and point to this project/ Or you can open this project with eclipse whichever will work
3./ I have manually put twitter4j API in here so you don't have to download them
	but if any problems occur please refer to here:
	http://twitter4j.org/en/index.html
	I am getting the builded libraries: twitter4j-4.0.2-SNAPSHOT.zip
	In there you will need 1 libraries: twitter4j-core-4.0.2-SNAPSHOT (in lib folder)
4./ Right click on the project on Eclipse and choose: Build Path/Add External Archieve (or external Jar/or something similiar along that line. This is different from each version of eclipse)
5./ Choose the twitter4j-core-4.0.2-SNAPSHOT that I have attached or the download version that you prefer
6./ The error should be gone and you can click run icon

So basically, I use my account for the sake of simplicity because it speeds up the process.
You can replace with your credential by changing:
	static final String ACCESS_KEY = "2163998690-28tx0JdKCJynvlL20Tkmd9TopMOGd0HpJPwxaD4";
	static final String ACCESS_SECRET ="P2kChTQFUunhqCigQT0OjjW6AGSP1T46MYyuT6MWqWNg5";
	static final String CONSUMER_KEY = "gJsuxchYzgRFRcPGwDNaQcwmW";
	static final String CONSUMER_SECRET="xSAQNBycKbm8d9ZtWplZfvV6pB5QdXIR2j0dr8QDRewnCd4xJJ";
	
	How to look for these, please visit twitter developer site and register

But you can surely keep mine just to play with dataIO
What I did here is pulling the latest 5 tweets from my account
So clicking run you might get an output like this or it might be updated but will be similiar:

Implementation

I have Main.java which hook up with twitter using my credentials
I also have DataIO.java which will be our main class that perform data manipulation
Later on we will have keyphrase extraction algorithm and so on, but let play around with these and make sure you understand this simple structure first. 
Let me know if you have any questions
